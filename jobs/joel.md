To whom it may concern,

It is my pleasure to recommend Nate Stemen for a research internship in quantum computing at Microsoft.
Nate joined my group at the University of Waterloo in the Fall of 2020 and has proven to be an exceptional graduate student.

Despite having spent 3 years outside of academia, Nate got started in our group very quickly.
Within the first semester Nate was presenting papers we read as a group and was contributing valuable insight as well as demonstrating his comprehension of background material.
By the end of his first semester he had learned a tremendous amount of material focused on our area of research, all while completing 3 courses (most graduate students take 2) and scoring well.

Nate it well suited for research particularly because he is able to leverage his organizational skills as well as his professional experience outside of academia.
Whether it's writing notes from his readings, or scheduling our group and 1-1 meetings, Nate has demonstrated a professionalism that I haven't seen among many graduate students.
Nate has also not let the pandemic/remote work stop him accomplishing his goals and has taken the situation in stride.
These three factors combine to make Nate a great candidate to push forward the forefront of quantum technologies at a place like Microsoft.

While I haven't had the pleasure of teaching Nate in the (virtual) classroom, he has done very well academically while being engaged with the community at IQC and the university as a whole.
Nate has completed the universities "Fundamentals of University Teaching program" that helps teach graduate students evidence based teaching methods, served on 2 committees, and sent himself to a virtual conference.
All the while he has had quite a turbulent graduate career: from being entirely remote, to me leaving the university partway through his studies Nate has had to manage many more difficulties than the average student.
These are facts not to encourage pity, but rather to frame his success despite serious adversity.

I admire Nate's ability to push through difficult times, determined to make the best of any situation, but what I like most about Nate is his eagerness to learn and capacity to ask probing questions.
He has a strong drive to understand 'the why' of what he is doing.
That has served him well here, and I am confident he will continue to succeed if given the chance at Microsoft.

Best,

Joel Wallman PhD
