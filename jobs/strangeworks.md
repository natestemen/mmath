# Anything else we should know?

As a current PhD student, I'm looking for a summer internship position to help bolster my experience, and give my research on quantum error correcting technologies more context.
I'm interested in both research internships, as well as content development ones where I might lend my knowledge of quantum information to explain how Strangeworks... works!
I believe I am well suited to work at Strangeworks because of my previous software experience will mean I can work on software projects with less time getting up to speed.
I hope to utilize this experience to become a more well rounded researcher, and use this opportunity to frame my future research.
