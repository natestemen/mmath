# CTE Requirements

I'm getting lost trying to track what I've done and what I need to do to complete the teaching program.

## Fundamentals of University Teaching Program
Information for this found here: https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/support-graduate-students/fundamentals-university-teaching-program

### Requirements
6 workshops:
- [x] Supporting Student Mental Health (CTE2259)
- [ ] Inclusive Teaching (CTE2409)
- [ ] Effective Lesson Plans (CTE1202)
- [ ] Workshop 4
- [ ] Workshop 5
- [ ] Workshop 6

3 micro-teaching sessions:
- [ ] Session 1
- [ ] Session 2
- [ ] Session 3

Once this is complete I can apply for the Certificate in University Teaching: https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/support-graduate-students/certificate-university-teaching. In order to get into that I should have at least 4 terms left in my PhD. That means I need to complete the fundamentals program by the end of my third year, but I think I should aim to have it done in 2 years.
