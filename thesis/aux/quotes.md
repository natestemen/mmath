They didn't have much trouble
teaching the ape to write poems:
first they strapped him into a chair,
then tied the pencil around his hand
(the paper had already been nailed down).

and whispered into his ear:
You look like a god sitting there.
Why don't you try writing something?
--â€• James Tate, Selected Poems

--- Simone de Beauvoir
