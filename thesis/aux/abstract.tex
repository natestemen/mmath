\chapter*{Abstract}

This thesis details the problem of quantum circuit compilation.
Starting from the very definition of compile, we introduce many of the ideas needed to understand the main problem of circuit compilation from the very basics.
We cover classical compilers and show how the effort to build effective circuit compilers draws heavily from its classical counterparts.
Upon introducing the formalism of quantum computation, we are able to formulate many of the problems related to circuit compilation in a mathematical language, and detail some of the cutting edge efforts.
We end by showing how circuit compilation is part of a much larger ``quantum stack'' that needs to be created to have effective quantum computers.
