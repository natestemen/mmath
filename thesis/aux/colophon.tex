\section*{Colophon}
This document was typeset using the typographical look-and-feel \texttt{classicthesis} developed by Andr\'e Miede and Ivo PletikosiÄ‡.
The style was inspired by Robert Bringhurst's seminal book on typography ``\emph{The Elements of Typographic Style}'' and is available at:

\end{center}

Hermann Zapf's \emph{Palatino} and \emph{Euler} type faces are used and the ``typewriter'' text is typeset in \emph{Bera Mono}.
