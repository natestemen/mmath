\chapter{Conclusion}
% ***********************************************

In this document we have covered the basics needed to understand the problem of quantum circuit compilation.
In doing so we have introduced the prerequisite ideas from classical computing such as compilers, and the basics of computer architecture insofar as to understand the necessity of compilers.
With a brief introduction to both quantum computation and the capabilities/limitation of modern-day quantum hardware we formalized one of the main questions in circuit compilation: that of the qubit mapping problem.
We also covered multiple secondary questions that arise in circuit compilation, along with detailing current research to solve these problems.
Finally we introduced some of the many tools under current construction to aid in the creation of a fully functioning quantum stack.
