In this chapter we'll introduce the main ideas from Lie groups and Lie
algebras. We'll start by defining what a Lie group is in abstract, and then
introduce a simpler definition that works for the Lie groups we'll meet in
quantun information.

\section{Topological Prerequisites}
In this section we'll cover/review some of the helpful topological
concepts that are used implicitly in much of Lie theory.
