# [Some Remarks on Writing Mathematical Proofs - John M. Lee](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~lee/Writing/writing-proofs.pdf)

- Identify your audience
  - For homework assignments, write as if convincing a fellow student
- Write in paragraph form
  - Writing for a _human_ reader, and we like to read sentences/paragraphs.
- Use proper grammar
- "If the structure of your proof is anything other than a simple direct proof, state at the beginning what type of proof you're using ("we weill prove the contrapositive" or "we will prove this by induction," for example)."
- Include motivation
- Use "we" instead of "I"
- Avoid abbreviations (even "iff" according to Lee)
- Proofread
- Typeset properly
  - Label theorems/props/lemmas/etc
  - Know the difference between theorem, proposition, lemma, and corollary
  - Delineate where proofs start and stop
  - A mathematical symbol must appear the same every time it is used
- Write precisely
  - For every sentence ask yourself:
    - What does it mean? (ensure everything in youre sentence is defined and symbols are clear)
    - Why is it true?
- Include the right amount of detail
- "Avoid writing two in-line formulas separated only by a comma or other punctuation mark, because they will look like one long formula."
