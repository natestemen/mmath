# nate is a master of mathematics

Literally.
The University of Waterloo granted me an [MMath degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Mathematics) after my advisor left while pursuing my PhD.
This was my repository for all things Waterloo during that period (2020-2022).
Please poke around and have some fun.
If you find anything that is of use to you, let me know!
